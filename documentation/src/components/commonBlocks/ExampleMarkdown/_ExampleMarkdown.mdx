Underscore in name is must

To import

```js
import Example from "@site/src/components/commonBlocks/ExampleMarkdown/_ExampleMarkdown.mdx";
```

To use:

```jsx
<Example />
```

Also supports props via jsx inside mdx snippet

```jsx
{props.name}
```

Imports can be relative for docs: only underscore is must. Just change path to relative, delete `@site` alias
